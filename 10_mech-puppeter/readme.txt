MECH Puppeteer v1.01					         March 14, 2006
==================

   Hello, and thank you for trying out my program. I hope it will help enhance your Robonova-1 
experience some. This application was intended to be used simply as a testing tool in relation 
to my bluetooth module. It's capabilities don't reach any further than the RoboRemmocon 
software supplied with the Robonova-1, but in my opinion, looks cooler. Enjoy!
Please forward any comments, questions, or suggestions to nerds@earthlink.net with the
subject: "MECH Puppeteer", or I may not get it.
   Thanks again,
      Matt
